## History of the Heelflip

The heelflip (a.k.a. heel or heelie), is an aerial skateboarding trick where the skateboarder kicks out in front of him/her flipping board 360 degrees along the board's long axis.

A heelflip is executed similarly to the ollie, and like the ollie has become a defining trick of "New School" skateboarding

### Execution

A heelflip is the opposite of a kickflip, as the board spins towards the toes. For a regular skater (left foot in front) the board spins clockwise from the perspective of one behind the skater. Again, there is a kick as part of the ollie but unlike the kickflip it is directed forward and outwards away from the rider's toe side (diagonal), so that the last part of the foot to leave the board is the heel, hence the name. 

### Variations
Variations and extensions of the standard heelflip are very common - some of these are: 

#### Heelflip Variations
- Double Heelflip, where the board flips twice before being caught.
- Triple Heelflip, where the board flips three times before being caught.
- Laser flip, a combination of the Frontside 360 pop shove-it and the Heelflip. The opposite of a 360 flip.
